### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an enthusiastic free software developer with a predilection for
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and for
[Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) in particular.

On this page you'll find an overview of my projects and activities. More
information about me and my interests, you can find on [my (not, yet, very
elaborate) blog](https://dalanicolai.github.io/notes/). As you will probably
notice from the information below, I am a quite active contributor to Spacemacs
and also you can often find me providing support at [Emacs
stackexchange](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/users/26163/dalanicolai) and the
[Spacemacs Gitter](https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs/) channel.

## Projects
### Emacs
* [image-roll](https://github.com/dalanicolai/image-roll.el) (successor of [pdf-continuous-scroll-mode](https://github.com/dalanicolai/pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el))
* [create patch for doc-view EPUB
  support](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-01/msg00976.html)
  this feature will be available in pdf-tools also, when using the new
  alternative pdf-tools server (see next point)
* [alternative pdf-tools server](https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools/pull/61) An
  alternative backend for pdf-tools written in python using the
  [pymupdf](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
* [toc-mode](https://melpa.org/#/toc-mode): The best way to add a (missing)
  Table of Contents/Outline to your PDF or DJVU documents.
* [mediator](https://github.com/dalanicolai/mediator): Provides an 'open with'
  dialog for Emacs on freedesktop.org compliant desktop environments (i.e. most
  mainstream GNU/linux desktop environments).
* [sketch-mode](https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/sketch-mode.html): Quickly create SVG
  sketches with mouse and keyboard from within Emacs. Although the package might
  be useful to users that want simple sketches (and quickly insert them into
  some buffer), this is more of an experimental/demonstration package. It would
  be great to rewrite it so that, the code/definition for the sketch is inserted
  to a buffer while sketching. This, of course is perfectly possible, but time
  and money prevent me from implementing it (while there are great alternatives
  also, like e.g. the sketching features in
  [TeXmacs](https://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/home/welcome.en.html)).
* [djvu3](https://github.com/dalanicolai/djvu3): Extension to djvu.el to make it
  a full featured pdf-viewer (besides being a powerful editor).
* [Spacemacs EAF layer](https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+tools/eaf/README.html)
* [Spacemacs djvu layer](https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+readers/djvu/README.html)
* [Various personal Spacemacs layers](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/discussions/14757#discussioncomment-714850)

### Activities
[Smaller contributions to many projects](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed+author%3Adalanicolai)

e.g.:
* [auto fetch metadata with
  calibredb.el](https://github.com/chenyanming/calibredb.el/pull/10): Fetches
  after [detecting the ISBN
  automatically](https://github.com/chenyanming/calibredb.el/pull/13)
* [fix pyvenv tracking mode in
  Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/pull/13927): Automatically
  change python virtual environment when changing buffers
* [add grip-mode to Spacemacs github layer](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/pull/13927)
